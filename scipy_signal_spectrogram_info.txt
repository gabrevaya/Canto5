scipy.signal.spectrogram

scipy.signal.spectrogram(x, fs=1.0, window=('tukey', 0.25), nperseg=256, noverlap=None, nfft=None, detrend='constant', return_onesided=True, scaling='density', axis=-1, mode='psd')[source]

    Compute a spectrogram with consecutive Fourier transforms.

    Spectrograms can be used as a way of visualizing the change of a nonstationary signal’s frequency content over time.
    Parameters:	

    x : array_like

        Time series of measurement values

    fs : float, optional

        Sampling frequency of the x time series. Defaults to 1.0.

    window : str or tuple or array_like, optional

        Desired window to use. See get_window for a list of windows and required parameters. If window is array_like it will be used directly as the window and its length will be used for nperseg. Defaults to a Tukey window with shape parameter of 0.25.

    nperseg : int, optional

        Length of each segment. Defaults to 256.

    noverlap : int, optional

        Number of points to overlap between segments. If None, noverlap = nperseg // 8. Defaults to None.

    nfft : int, optional

        Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired. If None, the FFT length is nperseg. Defaults to None.

    detrend : str or function or False, optional

        Specifies how to detrend each segment. If detrend is a string, it is passed as the type argument to detrend. If it is a function, it takes a segment and returns a detrended segment. If detrend is False, no detrending is done. Defaults to ‘constant’.

    return_onesided : bool, optional

        If True, return a one-sided spectrum for real data. If False return a two-sided spectrum. Note that for complex data, a two-sided spectrum is always returned.

    scaling : { ‘density’, ‘spectrum’ }, optional

        Selects between computing the power spectral density (‘density’) where Pxx has units of V**2/Hz and computing the power spectrum (‘spectrum’) where Pxx has units of V**2, if x is measured in V and fs is measured in Hz. Defaults to ‘density’

    axis : int, optional

        Axis along which the spectrogram is computed; the default is over the last axis (i.e. axis=-1).

    mode : str, optional

        Defines what kind of return values are expected. Options are [‘psd’, ‘complex’, ‘magnitude’, ‘angle’, ‘phase’].

    Returns:	

    f : ndarray

        Array of sample frequencies.

    t : ndarray

        Array of segment times.

    Sxx : ndarray

        Spectrogram of x. By default, the last axis of Sxx corresponds to the segment times.

DEFINITION of 'Detrend'

In forecasting models, the process of removing the effects of accumulating data sets from a trend to show only the absolute changes in values and to allow potential cyclical patterns to be identified. This is done using regression and other statistical techniques.
